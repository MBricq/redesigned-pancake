## redesigned-pancake

This is a project Alain Duchoud and myself worked on for the course Microcontroller given Prof. Schmid at EPFL.

The project was realized in Assembly and the goal was to work on a temperature sensor. The system displays the live temperature using a step motor and a pointer and can be controlled using an infrared remote control. It can be used to detect if the temperature goes below or higher than a chosen temperature, which would pulled up a chosen pin on the board, allowing the user to connect a reaction mechanism.

Here is a demonstartion in French:
